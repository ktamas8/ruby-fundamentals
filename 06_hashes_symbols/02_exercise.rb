A NIGHT AT THE MOVIES

Keeping track of all the parts of our digital lives is a pain. Now that you know how to write Ruby, however, you can make things easy for yourself! Let’s start by creating a program that will keep track of our movie ratings.

It’ll do one of four things: add a new movie to a hash, update the rating for an existing movie, display the movies and ratings that are already in the hash, or delete a movie from the hash. If it doesn’t receive one of those four commands, the program will output some kind of error message.

This project will give you a lot of room for creativity, but we know sometimes it can be a little disorienting to not have strict instructions. If you ever feel lost, don’t hesitate to check out the example code in this exercise to help you along!
