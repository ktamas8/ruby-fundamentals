We noticed in the last lesson that .sort! didnâ€™t have a built-in way of handling sorting in reverse alphabetical order.
Now that we know how to write our own Ruby methods, we can fix that!
Write a method that is
- named alphabetize
- first parameter is an array of book titles (strings)
- second parameter is a boolean that tells wether we want to sort by reverse order or not

You can use this book list as parameter:
['Heart of Darkness', 'Code Complete', 'The Lorax', 'The Prophet', 'Absalom, Absalom!']

Call the method in regular and reverse order too
