# You can think of a module as a toolbox that contains a set methods and constants.
# There are lots and lots of Ruby tools you might want to use, but it would clutter
# the interpreter to keep them around all the time. For that reason, we keep a bunch
# of them in modules and only pull in those module toolboxes when we need the constants
# and methods inside!
#
# You can think of modules as being very much like classes, only modules can't create
# instances and can't have subclasses. Theyâ€™re just used to store things!
